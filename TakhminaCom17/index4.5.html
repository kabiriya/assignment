<h1> Cinderella </h1>
<p> Cinderella (Italian: Cenerentola, French: Cendrillon), or The Little Glass Slipper, is a folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression and triumphant reward. Thousands of variants are known throughout the world. The title character is a young woman living in unfortunate circumstances, that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune. The story of Rhodopis, recounted by the Greek geographer Strabo around 7 BC, about a Greek slave girl who marries the king of Egypt, is usually considered to be the earliest known variant of the Cinderella story. The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his Pentamerone in 1634; the most popular version was published by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps pass√© in 1697, and later by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales in 1812. <br>

Although the story's title and main character's name change in different languages, in English-language folklore Cinderella is the archetypal name. The word Cinderella has, by analogy, come to mean one whose attributes were unrecognized, or one who unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect. The still-popular story of Cinderella continues to influence popular culture internationally, lending plot elements, allusions, and tropes to a wide variety of media. The Aarne-Thompson-Uther system classifies Cinderella as Tale Type 510A, Persecuted Heroine. <br> </p>

<h1> Asian versions </h1>

<h2> Ye Xian </h2>

<p> The story of Ye Xian reflected the admiration for small feet in ancient China. Foot binding later became a common practice to prevent feet from growing.
A version of the story, Ye Xian, appeared in Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang by Duan Chengshi around 860. In this version, the protagonist is Ye Xian, a hardworking and lovely girl, who befriends a fish, which is the reincarnation of her deceased mother. Her stepmother and sister kill the fish, but Ye Xian saves the bones, which are magic, and they help her dress appropriately for the New Year Festival. Her stepfamily recognizes her at the festival, causing her to flee and accidentally lose her slipper. Afterwards, the king finds her slipper and falls in love with her (eventually rescuing her from her cruel stepmother). Variants of the story are also found in many ethnic groups in China. <br> </p>

<h2> Sumiyoshi Monogatari' (The Tale of Sumiyoshi) </h2>

<p> The existing version of the Japanese tale dates back only the 13th century, but mention of it occurs in the early 11th-century Genji Monogatari (Tale of Genji). Sumiyoshi refers to a village and a shrine in the Osaka area. There in the shrine the Cinderella figure has taken refuge, when her lover, following a dream, is reunited with her.</p>

<h2> One Thousand and One Nights </h2>

<p> Several different variants of the story appear in the medieval One Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, including "The Second Shaykh's Story", "The Eldest Lady's Tale" and "Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers", all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others, they are male. One of the tales, "Judar and His Brethren", departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.
